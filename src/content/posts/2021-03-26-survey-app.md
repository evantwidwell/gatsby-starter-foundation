MERN app with Stripe, Google Auth, and WebSocket functionality. The app allows you to create email surveys, send them and get respnses delivered to your dashboard. The stripe functionality is in test mode so that you don't actually have to give me money. You can use 4242 4242 4242 4242 for a credit card number and whatever you want for the date and CVV to buy credits and send surveys.
